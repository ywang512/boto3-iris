<p>Hello,</p>


<p>I am Yifei Wang. Thank you for viewing my results!</p>


<p>This is a simple machine learning implementation of iris dataset in aws boto3 environment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>`iris-EDA.ipynb` and `iris-EDA.py` have the same functions for EDA dataset.</li>
  <li>`iris-models.ipynb` and `iris-models.py` have the same functions for training and evaluating different models.</li>
  <li>`iris-boto3.ipynb` and `access_ec2.sh` contains necessary functions for creating ec2 instance and transfering files to ec2 and s3.</li>
  <li>`model-pca-logistic.txt` and `model-MLP.txt` logs the outputs for training and evaluating two different models (PCA+Logistic and MLP).</li>
  <li>`Other graphics` using the same naming methods show the results of EDA and model evaluation.</li>
</ul>  

<p>Please also feel free to check out my github repo (https://github.com/ywang512/boto3-iris/) for more about this small project.</p>

<p>Thank you again for your time for viewing my results!</p>

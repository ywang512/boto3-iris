# boto3-iris

A simple machine learning implementation in aws boto3 environment

- `iris-EDA.ipynb` and `iris-EDA.py` have the same functions for EDA dataset.

- `iris-models.ipynb` and `iris-models.py` have the same functions for training and evaluating different models.

- `iris-boto3.ipynb` and `access-ec2.sh` contains necessary functions for creating ec2 instance and transfering files to ec2 and s3.

- `model-pca-logistic.txt` and `model-MLP.txt` logs the outputs for training and evaluating two different models (PCA+Logistic and MLP).

- Other graphics using the same naming methods show the results of EDA and model evaluation.
